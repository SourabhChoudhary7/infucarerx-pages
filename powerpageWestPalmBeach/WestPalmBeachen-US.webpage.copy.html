                          <li>Use a medication reminder box so that you or your caregiver can set out your pills.</li> 
                          <li>Keep a log of when to take your medications. Keep your medications where you will see them.</li>

                      <p>How will you know? Check the label or the patient information leaflet with your medicine.

                      <p><b class="fst-italic">Drug Take-Back Program or Hazardous Waste Collection Events:</b> To dispose of prescription drugs not labeled to be flushed, you may be able to take advantage of community drug take-back programs or other programs, such as household hazardous waste collection events, that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.</p>

                          <li> Mix drugs with an undesirable substance, such as used coffee grounds, dirt, or cat litter. This makes the medicine less appealing to children and pets and unrecognizable to someone who might intentionally go through the trash looking for drugs.</li>
                          <li>Put the mixture into a disposable container with a lid such as a re-sealable zipper storage bag, empty can, or other container to prevent the drug from leaking or spilling out.</li>
                          <li>Conceal or remove all your personal information, including the Rx number, on the empty medicine packaging to protect your identity and privacy by crossing it out with permanent black marker or duct tape or by scratching it off.</li>
                          <li>Place the sealed container with the mixture and the empty drug containers in the trash. Throw the packaging away.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>

                      <h5 class="heading-color fw-bold pt-2">Advanced Directives:</h5>
                      <p>Advance directives are written, legal instructions that explain what kind of medical care you do or do not want if you ever become terminally ill or seriously injured and are unable to make decisions for yourself. Advanced directives guide choices for doctors, family members and caregivers which help you to plan-ahead, so you receive the care you want.</p>
                      <p>Advanced directives need to be in writing. Each state has different forms and requirements. Below is some general information which may be helpful.</p>
                      <p>There are two types of Advance Directives. One is called a living will and the other is called a durable power of attorney for healthcare.
                        <ul>
                          <li>A living will is a written, legal document that clearly states the medical treatments you would and would not want to be used to keep you alive, as well as other decisions such as pain management or organ donation.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>You should address several possible end-of-life care decisions in your living will. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about your options.
                        <ul>
                          <li>A durable power of attorney for healthcare is a type of advance directive in which you name a person to make decisions for you when you are unable to do so. In some states this directive may also be called a medical or health care power of attorney or a health care proxy.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>You may also choose one or more alternates in case the person you chose is unable to fulfill his or her role.</p>
                      <p>Review your advance directives with your doctor and your health care agent to be sure you have filled out forms correctly. When you have completed your documents, you need to do the following:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Keep the originals in a safe but easily accessible place.</li>
                          <li>Give a copy to your doctor.</li>
                          <li>Give a copy to your health care agent and any alternate agents.</li>
                          <li>Keep a record of who has your advance directives.</li>
                          <li>Talk to family members and other important people in your life about your advance directives and your health care wishes.</li>
                          <li>Carry a wallet-sized card that indicates you have advance directives, identifies your health care agent, and states where a copy of your directives can be found.</li>
                          <li>Keep a copy with you when you are traveling if you are hospitalized or enter a skilled care facility.</li>
                          <li>Periodically review and make changes as necessary to ensure your choices are still what you want.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>If you want to make changes to your Advanced Directives, you must create a new form, distribute new copies, and destroy all old copies. Specific requirements for changing directives may vary by state.</p>
                      <p>You do not need to have an advance directive or living will to have Do Not Resuscitate ("DNR") and Do Not Intubate ("DNI") orders. You can make your preferences known to your physician, who can write the orders and put them in your medical record. If you have a living will, however, be sure to mention whether you have a DNR or DNI order on file. For more information on Advanced Directives, you may want to contact your attorney, local hospital, home health agency, hospice agency or state medical society.</p>
